NILFS Snapshot Manager
----

NILFS Snapshot Manager is a daemon to convert nilfs checkpoints to snapshots
and mount the snapshots to specified mount points.

NILFS Snapshot  Manager is distributed in two parts.  The first part is the
NILFS2 python module that provides the functionality to manage nilfs2 volumes.
The other part is the daemon script which keep track of the nilfs2 checkpoints.
If checkpoints are created, it converts it to snapshot then mount the
snapshot to specified directory.

Require:
    *  python-yaml
    *  python-daemon
    *  python-gobject
    *  python-setuptools (for installation)

Install:
    # python setup.py install

Configure:

After install the scripts, you have to edit the /etc/nilfs_ss.conf
to tell the daemon which device is the nilfs volume you want to watch,
and which directory is the mount point to mount the managed snapshots.

Run:
    # nilfs2_ss_manager -f <config>

    will start the script in daemon mode.
    If you want to run without going to daemon mode, you will specify '-D'.
